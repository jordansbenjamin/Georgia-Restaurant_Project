# Georgia Restaurant - Project

## Overview
This project is simply a practice for me, mainly practicing my CSS and in this case specifically my SCSS skills. As I'll be using SCSS to style this fake restaurant web page project. 

The goal is to familiarise myself with core components of CSS styling in general, but also getting used to the workflow of using SCSS. 

Especially with learning how to organise partial files, and using SCSS exclusive properties of using variables, mixins, functions, etc. 

On top of that, I will be using version control and practicing my git as well. I will be pushing this to my GitHub and it will be made public at least for now. 

Here we go.
